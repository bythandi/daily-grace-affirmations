🌿 Daily Grace Affirmations

A ByThandi creation — where calm meets creativity and faith meets flow.

✨ Overview

Daily Grace Affirmations is a Streamlit-powered reflection app designed to bring faith, creativity, and gentle self-discipline into a single moment of grace.

Rooted in the ByThandi ecosystem, it began as a Python learning experiment and blossomed into a living system of encouragement — a tool that turns small reflections into sacred rhythms.

Built in Thandi’s Python Corner, this app marks a union of design, devotion, and digital craftsmanship — a reminder that code, too, can be a form of prayer.

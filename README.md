Perfect 🌸 — here’s the **refreshed and renamed README** for your project, now aligned with the **Daily Grace Affirmations** identity.
It keeps the poetic rhythm and reflective warmth of the Divine Systems version but presents *Daily Grace* as its own standalone experience — graceful, grounded, and portfolio-ready.

# 🌸 Daily Grace Affirmations

*A ByThandi creation — where calm meets creativity and faith meets focus.*

---

## ✨ Overview

The **Daily Grace Affirmations** app is a Streamlit-powered reflection tool that helps users centre their day in faith, creativity, and gentle discipline.

Rooted in the ByThandi ecosystem, it began as a learning experiment in Python and evolved into a soulful digital companion — one that blends code, design, and devotion into a simple daily practice.

Built in the **Python Corner** — Thandi’s creative lab for divinely inspired code — this project bridges the sacred and the systematic, inviting users to breathe, reflect, and realign.

## 🌼 The Journey — *From Curiosity to Grace*

### **Day 1 — The Spark**

> “I wanted to learn Python… so I built an affirmation tool.”

* Began in Google Colab with a few lines of code and a calling to create.
* Learned the basics of `random`, `json`, and `datetime`.
* Discovered that even syntax errors can teach patience and trust.

---

### **Days 3–5 — Debugging as Devotion**

* Faced JSON quirks, session resets, and formatting frustrations.
* Learned that every bug is an opportunity to listen and grow.
* Styled the interface to reflect the soft hues of ByThandi’s brand palette.

> “Every function I fixed became a faith function.”

---

### **Days 6–8 — The Breakthrough**

* Transitioned from Colab tunnels to **Streamlit Cloud**.
* Expanded the affirmation bank to 20+ faith-coded entries.
* Introduced category filters for *Create · Build · Believe · Weave*.
* Declared the first stable version: **Daily Grace Affirmations v1.0.**

> “Pre-AI coding era could never.” 😂

## 💖 Reflection

**Daily Grace Affirmations** began as code but became communion —
a meeting place between structure and spirit, where systems can still feel soft.

It’s proof that when we build with presence, even a Python app can become a prayer.

> “Debugging isn’t failure; it’s conversation.”
